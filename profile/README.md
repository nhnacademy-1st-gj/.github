üí°Learned Comprehensive Backend Knowledge and Skills
----------------
During the NHN Academy Java Backend Course, I gained comprehensive knowledge and skills required for the backend developer role. I mainly focused on Java and Spring and learned in-depth about development environment, network, servlet, TDD, clean code, database, JPA, Spring Core, Spring MVC, Spring Security, and Spring Boot.
<br/>


‚ö°Ô∏èPractical Experience and Challenges
--------------
Through practical assignments given daily and weekly evaluations based on what we learned during the week, I had many opportunities to apply what I learned and grow my skills. Despite the high difficulty level of the evaluation assignments, I was able to overcome the challenges through discussions with my fellow students, dedicated research, and taking the time to write the code myself.

In addition, this experience taught me the value of doing my best. When I put in my best effort to solve a problem and then find a more efficient way to refactor the code, the sense of accomplishment is priceless. This valuable experience gave me the drive to continue pushing forward and striving for excellence.

üìàProfessional and Personal Growth
--------------
During the program, I realized that my understanding of what it means to develop backend applications was limited. However, through the NHN Academy Java Backend Course, I learned in detail about the role and developed a better understanding of my professional interests. I also realized that if I can strengthen my foundation in computer science, I can become an even better programmer.

Based on my growth through the program, I am now working on my own Java project while studying computer science fundamentals. This has allowed me to continue my personal and professional growth beyond the program and set new goals for myself.

‚úÖNew Goal: Becoming an Expert
--------------
Attending the NHN Academy Java Backend Course provided me with the privilege of learning from and communicating with experts who hold positions such as CTO, Senior Manager, and Senior at NHN Dooray!. This experience inspired me to set higher goals for myself and become an expert in my field. With determination, I will work towards my new goal and enjoy continuous learning like those professionals.

To achieve this goal, I have set short-term objectives, which include deploying the delivery order program I am currently developing to make it available for users to utilize. 
**I will take it slowly but always move forward along the path of a developer.**
